    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\\\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\\\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\\\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives (all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall (sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives (words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam (including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam (all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average (harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score (we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "- It is used in ordering results by probability, and modelling marketing responses.\n",
    "- It's fast to train, simple to understand and explain, really good at predicting probabilities of an event, and computes a confidence interval.\n",
    "- Does not goes well with non-linear classification problems, it is essential to perform feature selection, and colinearity and outliers take a big hit on the model.\n",
    "- I picked this one mainly because of it's speed and because it works with binary classification. Another minor reason, is that I wanted to use a linear method, to contrast it against the other two algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines (SVM):**\n",
    "- It is used in character recognition, image recognition, and text classification.\n",
    "- Good in a high-dimensional space, provides high accuracy, doesn't require any distribution requirements.\n",
    "- May be hard to interpret, it is memory dependent, very inefficient to train and takes a long time to tweak hyperparameters (because of the sheer number it has).\n",
    "- It may be a good algorithm for this problem because it handles well high-dimensionality (many  features after one-hot encoding), has a high accuracy and works well for classification and regression. Also, we are not handling a huge dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Boosting:**\n",
    "- It's a general well rounded algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression. Is used in search engines (ranking).\n",
    "- It is very accurate, handles well big amounts of data, it is quite flexible, works for classification and regression, and can use different loss functions.\n",
    "- It is prone to overfit without parameter tuning. Cannot be parallelized because trees are built sequentially.\n",
    "- This algorithm may be good in this case because we are dealing with a binary classification problem (in wich *Gradient Boosting* is good at), and well, because it is a generally good algorithm to use.\n",

    "I would recommend using *Gradient Boosting* for this problem base on the results. First of all, we can look at the F-Beta Score we had for 100% of the testing set, it has the highest value of the three models. And if we compare it to the F-Beta Score when used on the training we can see that results are very close together, suggesting that the model is not overfit. We can also take a look at the accuracy (although not that important for this problem) and see that _Gradient Boosting_ outperforms the other two models as well.\n",

    "We should also take into account the time each model takes to train and predict. It is specially concerning if we are to expose this model as a service of any kind. _SVC_ takes sustantial time to train when dealing with 100% of the training set, and is painfully slow with predictions, taking up to 15s. _Gradient Boosting_ may not be as fast as _Logistic Regression_, but it is not slow by any means, taking less than a fraction of a second to predict after being trained with 100% of the data.\n",

I think this is pretty much universal. From what I can see, it looks like `education-num` is just `education` but converted into a numerical value. If this assumption is true, both features are extremely correlated, so we could work with just `education-num` and get rid of `education`, as using both would making training slower.\n",

Information specially valuable to decide if they may be earning less than 50k.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Using only 5 features (although the most relevant ones) definitely takes a hit on the predictive power of the model, but not by much. Both, accuracy and F-score get lower scores, but F-score receives the highest hit with a reduction of 6.8%.\n",
    "\n",
    "If training time was a factor, I would definitely consider using a reduced dataset, but 5 features out of 104 (~5%) seems a bit too extreme, specially considering how fast this model can fit the data. Increasing the number of features from 5 to 20 (~20%) gets us a much higher accuracy and F-score (a decrease of only 1% compared to the full model). And even if the time doubles, if we take it into perspective, it barely took 7.5s to train, which still is insanely fast."
